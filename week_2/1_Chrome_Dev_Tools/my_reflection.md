# U1.W2: Chrome Dev Tools Challenge Reflection

* Describe the Document Object Model? What about it makes sense to you? What doesn't? What seems good and bad about it?

-I understand the DOM way better now than I did in week 1. The DOM is an object-oriented representation of an HTML file. It is handled in the browswer and provides a way to target HTML elements (and attributes) with CSS and scripting languages. Many resources refer to it as an API, which is a little confusing, because when I think DOM I actually visualize the tree-like structure thats created as opposed the code that's behind its functionality. I now understand (or think I understand) that the DOM encompasses not just this visual representation, but also the actual table that is sitting in your computer's memory and all of the code that allows us to interact with it. 

* How did using Chrome Web Tools to look at your site and a wordpress.com site compare?

-Now that I understand Web Tools better I was able to dig a little deeper when examining a wordpress site. Compared to my week 1 page, the wordpress page was significantly slower. The latency of loading my wordpress site was around 600 ms, compared to just 2 ms when loading one of my week 1 pages. I also compared recordings of the events and frames sectiosn under the Timeline tab and saw that there was a lot more scripting going on in the WordPress site. 

* Did you find Chrome Web Tools fun, helpful, or a pain to work with?

I've heard over and over that Web Tools is an important part of being a developer, so I took my time to learn it well. I found it extremely helpful, I enjoyed using it, and after going through this section I feel like I have a much better grasp on exactly what a 'Web Page' entails. 

* Did you have an "aha" moments or were any concepts solidified?

Beyond using the Elemnts tab to identify and play with CSS, my first exposure to Chrome Development Tools was during an audio version of one of Harvard's CS classes. I often listen when I'm in the car (I do a lot of driving) so I'm not always around a computer to test things out when I hear them. While learning about servers and requests, they used the network tab a lot so I had heard a lot about it and was excited that these tutorials covered that part of Web Tools. 

* Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.

Nope, yours were great for this section.
