# U1.W2: Thinking About Time Reflection

* What is your biggest time management challenge with during Phase 0? 

I touched on this last week, but my biggest time management challenge is my desire to learn everything about everything. Each link that DBC gives us on a topic has links to more articles, tutorials & refernce material and I want to know it all. As an example, one time I got side tracked and spent the entire day reading about character encoding. Give me a book on cryptography and I'll see you next week. 

I think this stems from the lack of structure that I've had the last couple years. Working for myself, I had the ability to set my own deadlines and finish client projects at my own (leisurely) pace. Normally my client workload is closer to 15 hours per week (a workload that i've carefully engineered), but this month is unusually busy, providing an additional time management challenege.


* How will you combat that? 

First and foremost I am going to stop reading about topics once I feel like I have enough knowlege to apply and explore them. My learning style was strong Kinesthetic, and I know that I solidify concepts best by doing, so I think this strategy will not only help my speed but also my understanding of the material.

I am also actively trying to lower my workload both by accomplishing things quicker for my clients and by taking on less projects. Once I'm back down to 15 hours per week, I will have the rest of phase 0 to get lost in my internet reading.

* What techniques will you try?

I've found that meditation helps a lot, especially with going to sleep at night. I've read all of 'Search Inside Yourself' and I was fascinated with the physical effects that meditation an have on your body. Meditating before bed (instead of watching another episode on netflix) helps me to relax, fall asleep quicker, and have more energy the next day. I was also intrigued by Dr. Fogg's research into habbits, and am interested in trying his technique to form some good long-term coding habbits.

* What is your overall plan for Phase 0?

My over-all plan for phase 0 is to learn as much as possible. I want to take advantage of my (normally) small client workload and dedicate my time to nailing the basics of web development so that I can hit the ground running when DBC starts. I also want to spend my last month and a half getting physically ready for DBC - eating right, exercising more, sleeping early, drinking less etc etc, so that I can have enough energy to power through our 16-hour days.
