# U1.W2: Responsive Design Reflection

* What is responsive web design? Do you like it?  Do you think it's a good practice? Why or why not?

Responsive web design is characterized by content that moves and re-sisizes based on the size of the viewer's screen. I think that it's a great practice because it 1) enhances the usability of websites and 2) gives developers the ability to serve specific content to different devices, allowing them to take advantage of new hardware with higher-resolution screens. 


* How do you think smartphones and tablets have changed web design? How do you think new technology will change web design in the future?

Talets and smartphones introduced two alternatives to the standard pc, each with their own form factors, and use-cases and design implications. It's not just the size of the screen that's different - although that's the most obvious change. People have completely different browsing habbits when using mobile devices: they use different apps, they don't always have internet connections, they want access to different functionality, and most of the time they don't need all the bells and whistles that can come with a desktop application. Developers were forced to re-think everything from pixel-size and content placement to offline storage and bandwidth allocation.

Give it 5-10 years and it will all change again. Soon enough we'll all be wearing contacts with HUDs and the visual display will be completely different. As we move forward, more and more devices will be able to connect to the web, so we will have to design interfaces for refrigerators and garage doors and cars and sprinkler systems. Eventually, I hope we figure out a way to bypass our sesnes and send information directly into our brains - at which point we'll be designing the web all over again. I can't wait. 


* How do you think visually impaired people use the web? Can they? Should we design and development for them?

Visually impaired people use the web with the help of specialized software like screen readers (or really nice friends!). These screen readers are built to read content from a web page in a specific way, so HTML documents need the correct symantics in order for them to output everything correctly. If we want visually impared people to visit and use our websites, we will definitely need to deign our pages with these tools in mind. On a more altrustic level, it is just nice/curteous thing to do. I don't, however, believe that websites should be penalized for failing to adhere to accessibility standards. Intuit recently settled a lawsuit over the accessibility of one of their websites, adding it to a large list of companies who have been sued over this topic.  


* What ideas and concepts have resonated with you when learning about the web and design? What seems stupid or doesn't make sense?

Responsive CSS definitely resonates with me. Media queries seem pretty straight forward and very powerful, and using %s for sizes and widths was an easy transition. I don't feel like I completely understand the use of em for sizing, but will definitely research. The other thing I've wondered about is using pixel widths in a responsive design (for example: on margins). I think mixing them in a little bit is okay, but once I play around with it more I'll have a much better feeling for it. 

* Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.

I found this tutorial on responsive design - it explains how to condense a nav into just one drop-down menu button: http://webdesignerwall.com/tutorials/css-responsive-navigation-menu
