# U1.W2: Design, User Experience, and creating your website Reflection

Discuss the following:
* What did you learn about design and user experience? 

First, I learned that design and user experience are not as easy as they look! Seeing different designer's takes on getting inspiration was very interesting. I've always seen my design friends looking at tons of other examples before doing their own work, so I was curious as to what the rules were. I thought the 'Good Theft' vs 'Bad Theft' slide did a good job of clearing everything up. Over-all, I'm pretty comfortable with design and UX and have a lot of great resources (people) to help me (or our cohort) clear up any issues. 

* Do you like design and user experience? Was it fun working on your site, the plan, and/or the wireframe? (If you hated it, that's OK too)

I had a blast working on my site. With these open-ended projects, I end up thinking about them non-stop on the day I tackle them. 

My girlfriend is a UX/UI designer at LinkedIn so I have had a fair amount of exposure to design. Wireframing definitely makes sense and helps me with the general layout, although I'm not at the point where making a HiFi mock would be a good use of my time yet. I still like to jump into the CSS and play around in order to determine my margins and width %'s and the exact spacing. Once I have more experience building websites, I think that sort of detail will come naturally. 

Overall I like design - I've subscribed to Adobe's Creative Suite for the last couple years and enjoy playing around in illustrator and photoshop. I do a lot of random projects in illstrator just to stay familiar with it and spent weeks in there on the design of my company's logo and business cards and website. In the end, coding is where my heart lies and I'm glad that it is a different disipline once you get to the professional level, but it's still a very important skill to have so I plan to keep up with it as much as possible.  

* What was your process? What worked and didn't work?

I used a 'desktop first' approach because I'm designing primarily for desktop. I started in Adobe Illustrator and drew out my homepage wireframe first, then adapted that to work for my blog and work templates. During the wireframe process, I was forced to thinking about the layout of the pages and the specific content that would go into them, which helped a lot for wrapping my head around all the components of the site. It was in this stage that I decided to add a bio page and a resources page. 

I've seen some nice hi-fi mocks before and thought it was nice that they had all the colors and div attributes all layed out, so I started to do that once i was done drawing my wireframes. I wasn't totally sure on everything, though, so it seemed like more trouble than its worth and i quickly opted to play with them during coding instead. 

During coding, I started with the HTML of each page and then moved onto the CSS. I started with my homepage, and then adapted that layout to fit the rest of the pages on the site. I spent some time playing around with colors (picking a theme or two from Adobe's Kuler app) and margins and padding and even stumbled upon a layout that I liked, but didn't want to use right now, so I sent it over to be the placeholder on my resources tab. Overall, I think that once I have a genearl plan for my sites, my styling time is better spent in the actual code testing out different combos. 

* What would you like to add or change about the site next?

I would like to hone the colors a little better - I'm not totally happy with them yet. I would also like to clean up my css document and add comments - I noticed that those things can get really big and messy, really fast. 

* Was it difficult to apply the material you learned? Did you find anything in your research you thought was super cool?

Beyond the UX/Design articles I didn't do any research to build the website. I didn't even go anywhere for inspiration besides the kuler color pallates - I wanted to do it all from scratch. It was very helpful, though, to have completed the sections on responsive design and intermediate html/css beforehand. I was able to apply a ton of the stuff that I learned earlier this week into it, especially the HTML5 semantics and some responsive design elements. 

I thought that initializer was really cool. It was a website template that was referenced in one of the resources. It gives you a bare-bones website template with all the core components that you need (such as modernizer.js). Once I practice a ton more and have HTML & CSS down, I plan to build my own template to use over and over again, but it's nice to know that these are out there when we want to throw up a site really quick and get to the MVP as fat as possilbe. http://www.initializr.com/

* Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.

This didn't necessarilly help me understand the topic, but I think this is a great resource:
