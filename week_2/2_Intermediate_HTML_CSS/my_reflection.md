# U1.W2: Intermediate HTML and CSS Reflection

* What do you think about web standards? Are they good or bad?

I've never been a big fan of rules. I've always had a high risk-tolerance and been willing to push the boundries. But when I was young, I heard this anecdote that's alwys stuck with me. When two cars are driving towards eachother on a narrow road, how is it that with nearly 100% consistancy they never hit eachother? It's because of rules. With nearly 200 million licensed drivers in the United States, the system requires standarization in order to work. Web standards are the same thing, and I appreciate that they are in place because they ensure that my designs will be accessible by the majority of the population. 

* Does the standard structure make sense to you? Why or why not?

The standard structure does make sense to me. It was slightly confusing at first because of the symantic meaning of the new structure elements - Sections, Articles, & Asides seem geared towards traditional information-based sites (like news). But once I became more familiar with the standards, it was clear that these new elements are broad enough terms that the structure can apply in some way/shape/form to most websites. 

* Do you like the new HTML5 elements, such as `<header>`, `footer`, and `nav`? Why or why not?

I'm all for more semantic meaning in the HTML markup. If nothing else, it's less keystrokes than `<div id="header">`. When we are designing websites for the general population it makes sense to standardize these elements to ensure that our content is as accessible as possible. When we build websites for ourselves (or when we become code ninjas and are sneaking around the deep web) we can build things however we want. 


* Why is reset.css necessary? 

reset.css is necessary because all browsers have different default styles. In order to get your page to look consistent across all browsers, you must 'reset' these default styles by explicitly stating them in a .css file. 

* What browsers have you used? Did you ever notice that sites looked different in different browsers? Do you think it's good or bad that they do?

I've used IE, Opera, Chrome, Firefox, Netscape, Safari, and many others that are built into mobile applications. When I built my company's website two years ago I spent a lot of time testing it out in different browsers, especially IE since the business demographic in a small town like Redding is slow to update their technology. Over-all, I think that it's okay for webpages to look a little different browser-to-browser. Just like we want to put our own unique style into developing our web apps, the browser developers put their own ideas and styles into their work. With very little effort (copy/paste reset.css) we can standardize these styles and make our sites consistent. 

* Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.

I read sitepoint's 'HTML5 & CSS3 for the Real World' which provided a good explanation of HTML5 stcuture, standards & features.
